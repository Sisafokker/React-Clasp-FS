PENDIENTES: 
(1) Disable Parcel's HMR when building for Production to avoid: ‚ùå"[parcel] üö® Connection to the HMR server was lost" 
(2) Keep researching ‚ùå"[GSI_LOGGER]: Missing required parameter: client_id."
(3) RESET PASSWORD: AppUsers: When you add a user from the app, we set a generic password "admin_generated"
This is valid for assigning a role and company relationships for GoogleSign AppUsers
BUT: If the user does not use the GoogleSignin, they will have to reset their password... set up RESET PASSWORD!
